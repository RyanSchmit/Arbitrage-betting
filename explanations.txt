American Odds (Money Spread)
(-) is always the favorite 
Bet more $, Win less $ because of the better odds

(+) is always the underdog
Bet less $, Win more $

Example: 
-120 Bills 
+100 Jets

Put $120 on the Bills, I gain $100 and get my money back, so my payout (I walk away with) 
is $220

If I put $100, I make $100, and payout of $200

Fractional Odds

80/1 Rich Strike

Put $100 on Rich Strike, I get a payout of $8,000

Point Spread:
(-) favorite team has to win by that amount of spread 
(+) underdog team has to lose by less than that amount of points

Put $100 on the Marlines, they have to loses by less than 4
